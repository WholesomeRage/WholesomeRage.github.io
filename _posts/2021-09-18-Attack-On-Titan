[i]Attack on Titan[/i]—[i]Shingeki no Kyojin [/i]if we’re being Like That, and we’re not—is a manga written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama, which ran from September 2009 to April 2021, and it’s bad. It’s so fucking bad.
And it's fascinating.

Narratively speaking, [i]Attack on Titan[/i] makes some incredibly stupid mistakes. But that’s the thing, right? It also does some things incredibly well. Only, those things it does incredibly well [i]actually make the story worse as a whole. [/i]It’s incredible. It’s super entertaining. Don’t read it. It blows.

So that’s what we’re talking about today. This review will be split in sections for ease of reading, and [b][u]it will contain full spoilers of everything [/u][/b][b][i][u]Attack on Titan[/u][/i][/b]. You don’t need to know anything about the series to understand this review, and I don’t recommend you read it if you haven’t already.
Let's get to it without further ado. We're going to talk structure, thesis, allegories--and for the love of God, we're going to talk politics.
